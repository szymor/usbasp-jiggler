# USBasp jiggler

This is an alternative firmware for USBasp that provides mouse jiggling functionality instead of programming AVR and compatibles.

## What does it do exactly?

After connecting to USB, it moves your mouse cursor along the circular path. You can change motion speed by setting the clock speed jumper.

## Why was it created?

I had a bunch of USBasps lying around my home, so I thought I would reuse one of them as a device for professional remote workers :)

Other than that, I just wanted to play around with USB and electronics during a weekend. I have no plans for further development.
